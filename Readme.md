# Recibase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/The-Silverwood-Institute/Recibase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/The-Silverwood-Institute/Recibase)

Recibase is a recipe ingestion and navigation service, designed to ease the choosing of what to cook.

Recibase works like so:

1. Write [CSON files][recipes] containing your recipes
2. Recibase reads in the recipes and adds them to a local database
3. [The frontend][frontend] lets you browse recipes by name, ingredient and more
